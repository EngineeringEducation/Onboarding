# Welcome!  
  
If this is your first time looking at this document, read the [onboarding guide](onboarding_guide.md).  

This repository should contain everything you need to follow the self-guided curriculum for Tradecraft Engineering. Self-guided curriculum is going to consist of external resources and internal resources.  
  
Start with Front-end Web. Next, iOS, then Server-side  

[Front-end Web](/front-end)  
Start here. The first 2 weeks of the engineering track are focused on this section.
  
[iOS](/ios)  
This comes after front-end web. The next 1.5 weeks are focused on this section.
  
[Server](/server)  
Server comes after iOS and builds upon some of the networking concepts you've already seen. We'll be doing a bunch of persisting and hooking up to web and iOS front-ends in this section.
