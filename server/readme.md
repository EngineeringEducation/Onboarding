# Server-side Engineering

**0** First, make sure you're very solid on Javascript. A great run-through to get you back in the game after iOS is to do this very first workshop:  
```shell
npm install -g javascripting
```

**1** Begin with LearnYouNode - the cannonical open-source workshop by the node.js community. It has a series of exercises that incrementally show you more and more of node. It should take you about 12 hours to complete, but those less comfortable with JS might take up to 16 hours.
```shell
npm install -g learnyounode
```

**2** Useful tutorials are listed below- they aren't required, but might help you in understanding some of the deeper node concepts.
```shell
npm install -g how-to-npm
npm install -g lololodash
```

Now it's time to start using express.js. We'll be working on these exercises:  
**3** [Mailing List](mailing_list.md) - Should take you a week to complete  
**4** [Persistence Layer (continuation of another project)](persistence_layer.md) - Should take 2 days to complete
