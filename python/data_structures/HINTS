###SPOILERS LEVEL 1
Identify what you don't know. You have not been asked to open a file and consume its contents yet. You also haven't been asked to use dictionaries yet. You will also need to figure out how to iterate through a dictionary. An important function for iterating through dictionaries is .items()

###SPOILERS LEVEL 2
Start with the smallest thing possible, copy a line out of the scores.txt file and see if you can parse it using split(), then use the resulting tokens to build a dictionary with one item in it.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 3
Using the 'main loop' methodology, make your program repeat the process until it consumes all the lines in the file.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 4
You can't sort a dictionary directly. You can, however, get the list of keys out of a dictionary and sort those. This lets you pull out values one at a time in alphabetical order.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 4
Pseudocode:
    # setup
    create an empty scores dictionary
    open the file 'sorted.txt'
    # main loop
    for each line in the file:
        split the line by the separator ":"
        using the first token as a key, insert the second token into the dictionary as a value

    create a list of keys
    sort the keys
    for each key in the sorted keys:
        print the restaurant name and score
