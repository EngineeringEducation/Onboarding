Timeline:

4:30
10-15 minuites
Janardan talks about how Computers Work

5 minuites
Take your chairs and stack them in that room over there, setup food

10 minuites
Explain the project with the constraints
	You can't talk, except to say the word error
	If you say the word error, you can't interact with that sandwich, someone has to handle it
	You can only refer to things you have written down already
	The goal is to serve sandwiches _as fast as you can_


5:00
10 minuites
Design the first system

15 minuites
Run the program
	Group 1 runs the program, group 2 gets sandwiches
	Group 2 asks for sandwiches, and times the average response

15 minuites
Recap
	Explain how your system worked.
	How many errors did you have?
	How many sandwiches did you successfully serve?
	How long was the average wait?
	Where did your system break down?
	What didn't you anticpate?
	

5:40
10 minuites
Iterate on the design of the first system (or throw it out entirely)
	Probably add "analytics"

15 minuites
Run the program
	Group 2 runs the program, group 1 gets sandwiches
	Group 1 asks for sandwiches, and times the average response

15 minuites
Recap
	Explain how your system worked.
	How many errors did you have?
	How many sandwiches did you successfully serve?
	How long was the average wait?
	Where did your system break down?
