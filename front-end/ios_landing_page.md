# iOS Landing Page

Congratulations! You've landed a job at a brand-new startup with some people you think are really great. There's a very talented iOS engineer at the head of the company, and his co-founder is a bang-up product guy. They've been hard at work producing a product, and it's time to see if anyone would be interested in the first iteration. We need a landing page! Nothing fancy, just something that shows off that an app exists and points you at where you can download it.  

Requirements:
* A one-page site that has the image of an iPhone on it, with a screencapture from our app in the phone.  
* Install google analytics, so we know how many people hit our site and how many click the iTunes link.  
* Don't use a template, our founder hates templates for some reason that totally doesn't break the fourth wall of this exercise!  
* The following marketing copy:
