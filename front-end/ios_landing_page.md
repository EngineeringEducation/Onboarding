# iOS Landing Page

## Phase 1
**Skills Needed:**  
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Google Analytics (how to embed)

Congratulations! You've landed a job at a brand-new startup with some people you think are really great. There's a very talented iOS engineer at the head of the company, and her co-founder is a bang-up product guy. They've been hard at work producing a product, and it's time to see if anyone would be interested in the next iteration.

She emailed you this today- time to get started!

[Our old landing-page is located here](http://www.ykombinator.com/), and now that we've pivoted to mobile we need to build an entirely new site. Use the same marketing copy- the app is the same, just on mobile now! We just need something that shows off that an app exists and points you at where you can download it.  

Requirements:
* A one-page site that has the image of an iPhone on it, with a screencapture from our app in the phone  
* Install google analytics, so we know how many people hit our site and how many click the iTunes link  
* Don't use a template, our founder hates templates for some reason that totally doesn't break the fourth wall of this exercise!  
* The marketing copy from our old site should be there, placed so that it looks nice

[Here are a few examples you could look at for inspiration](https://onepagelove.com/gallery/iphone-app). Our designers don't have time to write something up, so just get together what you can. We don't want to sink a lot of time into this, can you have it done tomorrow? We're doing a press release then and we want TechCrunch to have the link.
