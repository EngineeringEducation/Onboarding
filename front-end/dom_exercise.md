# DOM Exercise

I'm thinking, let's do a calendar scheduler thing, so people have to deal with time and stuff

there's also laundry timer that I can bring in

post-hoc goal, adapt this to jQuery

second post-hoc goal, bring in a server component to add persistence (maybe have been using localstorage) we can use mongodb to make the server component easy peasy.
